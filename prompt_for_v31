Update this codebase such that the chatbot works seamlessly and is integrated properly. Make sure nothing is breaking. Provide the updated production ready zip file
1. Provide the link to download the updated zip file here 
2. No external API. Don't use paid APIs 
3. Error Logs: for full screen mode: embed_custom.js:2 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'Streamlit' (at embed_custom.js:2:16)Understand this error VM3432 about:srcdoc:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setMode')     at VM3432 about:srcdoc:2:31 for popup mode error logs: Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. js/assets/index.dkn5mvff.js If you have a preferred way the chatbot backend should expose the bot (local module, FastAPI, gRPC, or subprocess), tell me so I can standardize to that. - Use the best possible smooth free method to do so 
 
Make sure other functionality is not hampered.
 
If feasible convert the entire js file to python but keep all the features as is. You can add more advanced feature as well but no feature already present goes missing. The chatbot should be properly integrated with the app and can answer every CA, maths or coding question. It should be able to write code as well. If kept in js, make sure it should be working and ready to be launched in market. Also make sure all bugs are fixed or handled properly such that the entire app works seamlessly
 
Finally provide the lnk to download the updated production ready zip file.
