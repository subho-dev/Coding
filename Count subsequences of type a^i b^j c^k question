Given a string s, the task is to count number of subsequences of the form aibjck, where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.

Note: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.


Examples:

Input  : abbc
Output : 3
Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc

Input  : abcabc
Output : 7
Subsequences are abc, abc, abbc, aabc
abcc, abc and abc


Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string s.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required output.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Length of string <=100

Example:
Input:
2
abbc
abcabc
Output:
3
7
